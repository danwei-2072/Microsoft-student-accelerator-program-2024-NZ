# Microsoft Student Accelerator Program 2024 NZ (NZMSA) - Data Science Project

## Project Overview
This repository documents the journey through the Data Science stream of the NZMSA (Microsoft Student Accelerator Program New Zealand) 2024 program. Structured across three phases, the program aimed to systematically build and apply data science and machine learning skills, culminating in practical project work and industry readiness.

This project demonstrated strong performance during the initial two phases, successfully advancing to the competitive Phase 3. Ultimately, after rigorous employer interviews, the author stood out from the candidate pool to become one of only ten participants who successfully secured a summer placement.
